# Intro to theming

Base Web ships by default with the `Light` theme. We understand that in some cases
you want to change the look and feel of the components. To do so, follow the steps
outlined here

## Using themeable values in component overrides

All themeable values are available within components that provide the `overrides` prop.

```jsx
<Input
  overrides={{
    Input: {
      style: ({$theme}) => ({color: $theme.colors.primary}),
    },
  }}
  placeholder="Custom input that uses themeable values"
/>
```

To learn more on how overrides work, check out [Better Reusable React Components with the Overrides Pattern](https://medium.com/@dschnr/better-reusable-react-components-with-the-overrides-pattern-9eca2339f646) article.

## The `ThemeProvider`

With the `ThemeProvider`, you can apply a theme to your application globally or locally. By default, Base Web ships with a light and a dark theme.

To use either the light or the dark theme in your application, you have to wrap your app with the `BaseProvider` that adds a `ThemeProvider` under the hood:

```jsx
import {LightTheme, ThemeProvider} from 'baseui';
import {Provider as StyletronProvider} from 'styletron-react';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <StyletronProvider value={engine}>
      <BaseProvider theme={LightTheme}>
        <YourApp />
      </BaseProvider>
    </StyletronProvider>
  );
}
```

If you'd like to use a different theme in one part of your application, \
you can locally wrap that part with the ThemeProvider to override the theme locally:

```jsx
import {DarkTheme, ThemeProvider} from 'baseui';

export default function SomeDarkThemedPages () {
    return (
      <ThemeProvider theme={LightTheme}>
        <div>
          This is a dark themed page - all the Base Web components used here will use the dark theme,
          as well as the theme object accessed through the styled function will use the values from the dark theme
        </div>
      </ThemeProvider>
    );
}
```

## Creating a custom theme

### Define your primitives

Primitives are used to define the colors and fonts for the components. An example of
primitives can be found in the [light theme primitives](https://github.com/uber-web/baseui/blob/master/src/themes/light-theme-primitives.js).

### Define any additional theme overrides

Theme overrides are used to change values in the theme like paddings or borders.
To learn more about what you can override, check out the [creator](https://github.com/uber-web/baseui/blob/master/src/themes/creator.js).

### Putting it all together

In practice, you can define your custom theme using this approach:

```js
import {createTheme, lightThemePrimitives} from 'baseui';

const yourTheme = createTheme(
  {
    ...lightThemePrimitives,
    // add all the properties here you'd like to override from the light theme primitives
    primaryFontFamily: '"Comic Sans MS", cursive, sans-serif',
  },
  {
    // add all the theme overrides here - under the hood it uses deep merge
    animation: {
      timing100: '0.50s',
    },
  },
);
```

## The shape of the theme file

<JSON src={LightTheme} />

## Next steps

Now that you have a solid understanding of Themes in Base Web, it's time to dive into the default [theme values](/theming/theming-values).

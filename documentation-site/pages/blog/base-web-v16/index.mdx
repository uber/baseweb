# Base Web v16 Released

After more than a year since our last update, we're releasing Base Web v16 with refreshed designs for Button, Button Group, and Tag components, plus a new Tag Group component.

We remain committed to maintaining the external codebase and documentation site, and we'll keep sharing updates and new features as they become available.

## Refreshed Button, Button Group, and Tag

Button, Button Group, and Tag components have updated designs with better visual consistency and improved accessibility. Your existing code continues to work without changes.

## New Tag Group Component

Tag Group simplifies managing multiple tags with built-in validation, and keyboard support.

```jsx
import { TagGroup } from "baseui/tag-group";

function MyComponent() {
  const [tags, setTags] = React.useState(["Design", "React", "UI"]);
  return <TagGroup tags={tags} onChange={setTags} />;
}
```

## Upgrade

```bash
npm install baseui@^16.0.0
```

Check out the [Button](/components/button), [Button Group](/components/button-group), [Tag](/components/tag), and [Tag Group](/components/tag-group) documentation for details.

# Changes in Base Web@v11

The latest Base Web major release removes tech debt that has been deprecated for roughly two years.
Many deprecated features have had warnings present at development-time and others will auto-fix
warnings when you have our [eslint plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-baseui) installed.

### `baseui/button`

- The `minimal` option for the Button `kind` prop is deprecated in favor of `tertiary`.

### `LocaleProvider`

- The `timePickerAriaLabel` prop is removed in favor of `timePickerAriaLabel12Hour` or `timePickerAriaLabel24Hour`.

### `baseui/modal`

- The `Backdrop` override property is removed in favor of `DialogContainer`.
- The `unstable_ModalBackdropScroll` prop is removed and become the default behavior.
- The `autofocus` prop is removed in favor of `autoFocus`.

### `baseui/phone-input`

- The design has been updated to split the dial code selector into a separate control (`CountryPicker`). Until now, it was available as [`PhoneInputNext`](https://baseweb.design/components/phone-input/#updated-phone-input-design). This is now default and `PhoneInputNext` is removed.
- The `CountrySelect` component is removed in favor of `CountryPicker`.

### `baseui/spinner`

- The design has been updated to use a fill without rounded corners. Until now, it was available now as [`StyledSpinnerNext`](https://baseweb.design/components/spinner/#spinner-next). This is now default and `StyledSpinnerNext` is removed.

### `baseui/accordion`

- The `renderPanelContent` prop is removed in favor of [`renderAll`](https://baseweb.design/components/accordion/#accordion-seo-friendly).

### `baseui/popover`

- Upgrade popperjs to v2. [Context](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/migration-guide/)
- Implement `popperOffset` prop to introduce padding between the popper and its reference element. Remove all css margins. [Context](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/migration-guide/#4-remove-all-css-margins)

### `baseui/radio`

- All overrides on the `RadioGroup` component is removed except for `RadioGroupRoot`. Overrides should be passed to `Radio` children instead.

### `baseui/select`

- The `SearchIcon` override is removed in favor of `StyledSearchIconContainer`. [Further context](https://github.com/uber/baseweb/pull/2397).

### `baseui/checkbox`

- The `checkmarkType` prop will use [`STYLE_TYPE.toggle_round`](https://baseweb.design/components/checkbox/#as-a-toggle) as the default value.
- Unlabeled checkboxes will no longer receive padding on the right side. [Further context](https://github.com/uber/baseweb/pull/2172).

**⚠️ This component is deprecated as of October 5th, 2024** when it becomes non-compliant with the requirements of PCI DSS v4. The component fails to meet the new compliance standards because it can access raw cardholder data directly. Ensuring PCI compliance requires that all sensitive cardholder data must be isolated within secure iframes or similar secure mechanisms.

The Payment Card input **automatically detects and formats credit card types**. It shows a small thumbnail icon of the parsed credit card brand to let users know they have entered their card in the correct format. The supported credit card brands are listed here:

<Table
  columns={["Card Type", "Example Number"]}
  data={[
    ["American Express", "378282246310005"],
    ["Diners Club", "36259600000004"],
    ["Discover", "6011111111111117"],
    ["ELO", "6550000000000001"],
    ["JCB", "3530111333300000"],
    ["Maestro", "6304000000000000"],
    ["Mastercard", "5555555555554444"],
    ["UnionPay", "6246729687894613"],
    ["Visa", "4111111111111111"],
  ]}
/>

The [card-validator](https://github.com/braintree/card-validator) library is used to determine the card format. It's also re-exported from `baseui/payment-card` as `valid` in case you need more metadata about the card.

This component is based on the [Input](/components/input) component. All of the props you can pass to `Input` also work on `PaymentCard`: `size`, `error`, `positive`, `disabled`, etc. The only exception to this is `overrides`, which has a [slightly different API](/components/payment-card/#overrides).

## Examples

<Example title="Basic usage" path="payment-card/controlled.tsx">
  <Controlled />
</Example>

<Example title="Default value" path="payment-card/defaultvalue.tsx">
  <DefaultValue />
</Example>

<Example title="Payment form" path="payment-card/form.tsx">
  <Form />
</Example>

If you'd like to add further validations, check out the [card-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/card-validator)
package that Base Web uses under the hood too.

<Example
  title="Stateful (uncontrolled) usage"
  path="payment-card/uncontrolled.tsx"
>
  <Uncontrolled />
</Example>

As with many of our components, there is also an [uncontrolled](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html) version, `StatefulPaymentCard`, which manages its own state.

<Exports
  component={PaymentCardExports}
  title="Payment Card exports"
  path="baseui/payment-card"

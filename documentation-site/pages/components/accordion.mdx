# Accordion

<Yard
  componentName="Accordion"
  placeholderHeight={180}
  {...accordionYardConfig}
/>

Accordions display a list of high-level options that can expand/contract to reveal more detailed information.

## Accessibility

- `tab`, `shift + tab` - to switch between panels.
- `space` or `enter` - when focus is on the accordion panel header it will toggle (expand or
  collapse) the currently focused panel.

## Examples

<Example title="Accordion basic usage" path="accordion/basic.js">
  <BasicAccordion />
</Example>

<Example title="Accordion SEO Friendly" path="accordion/renderpanelcontent.js">
  <AccordionSEO />
</Example>

<Example title="Accordion as a stateful component" path="accordion/stateful.js">
  <StatefulAccordion />
</Example>

**Note:** the `Panel` has the same overrides, with the exception of the `Root` subcomponent.

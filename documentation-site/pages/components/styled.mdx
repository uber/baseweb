# Styled

```js
import {styled} from 'baseui';
```

Base Web exports a modified version of [Styletron's](https://www.styletron.org/api/#styled) `styled` function.
This modified version has access to [theme variables](/theming/theming-values/):

<Example
  title="Styled reading from Theme values"
  path="examples/styled/basic.js"
>
  <StyledBasic />
</Example>

Since Styletron is already in your application and **you'll probably need to create new components anyway, we recommend you to use this `styled` function**!
Do you prefer other approaches when styling your components? Feel free to use
them in parallel to Base Web and Styletron. Styletron adds only `8kB` to your
bundle and works in an isolation.

If you are interested more into how this modified `styled` function is created, check the Styletron's [theme documetation](https://www.styletron.org/react/#themes).

## Additional State Props

When you [use overrides](/theming/understanding-overrides), you also get an access to additional component states, like `$disabled` or `$error`, depending
on the given component:

<Example
  title="Styled overriding subcomponents"
  path="examples/styled/overrides.js"
>
  <StyledOverrides />
</Example>

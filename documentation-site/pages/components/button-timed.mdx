# Button

<Yard placeholderHeight={52} {...buttonTimedYardConfig} />

Timed buttons are a variation of our primary rectangular buttons. Unlike like standard buttons, timed buttons auto-advance the user (i.e. invoke the onClick function) after a finite amount of time (usually few seconds).

## When to use

Timed buttons should be used sparingly for offers or autoconfirming non-critical decisions. They should be used only on primary actions to focus attention and reduce cognitive load. They should not be used for actions that are critical or require more decision-making time.

## Examples

<Example title="Deferred initialization" path="button-timed/paused.tsx">
  <Paused />
</Example>

Use the `pause` prop to declaratively start and pause the countdown timer.

<Yard componentName="Card" placeholderHeight={178} {...cardYardConfig} />

Cards are a self-contained unit of information, usually as part of a feed or series of similar
content. Cards have a dynamic range of modifiers that allow text-only, text and illustration,
and photography. All cards have an option to include text links or buttons as a primary action.
The entire card can become an active click-target.

# Layers

Every UI has stackable layers and it's important to have control over how the layers
play together. Some examples of the stackable layers are tooltips, modals, popovers,
select dropdowns or menus. The issues that come up along the layers usage are z-index
and visibility handling, what layer goes on top. There are many other layer
related issues that include focus management, hover management, keyboard navigation,
click events and hotkeys usage.

## LayersManager

In order to start leveraging the layers approach add a
[`BaseProvider`](https://baseweb.design/components/base-provider/) to your application.
It needs to be added at the root of the application. It will add the `LayersManager`.
Make sure you add the `BaseProvider` at the root of your application.

`LayersManager` creates two adjacent divs. Your application will be mounted into
the first div. The second div is used to host rendered layers. If the generated wrapper div
around your application conflicts with the layout styles, then use overrides to fix the issue.
For example, `overrides={{ AppContainer: { style: { height: '100%'} }}}`.

**Please note:** If you don't wrap the application in a `BaseProvider` all layers will be added
directly to the `body` element and may create conflicts with other libraries that may add
children to `body`.

Do not add the `BaseProvider` or `LayersManager` anywhere in the middle of your
application since the host element for layers added within its context will be
positioned at the point where the `LayersManager` is added and it will effect the layers stacking order.

## Layer

`Layer` component renders its children into a host element, instead of the `body`
element, using `createPortal`. The application needs to be wrapped in a `LayersManager`
in order to handle the rendering into a container. If no `LayersManager` is added
the content will be added to the `body`. With layers there is no need for `z-index`
css property usage as layers completely rely on the stacking context.

### Things you need to know when using z-index in an application

In general try to avoid using `z-index` in your component based application. If you need
to have a `z-index` added to some element on a page make sure it's within an ordered
stacking context. Read more on how to create a stacking context in the
[MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context).

**Please note:** `z-index`es within separate stacking contexts are not
compared and children within a stacking context that goes last will overlay those
with a higher `z-index` but within a separate stacking context that goes earlier
in the stacking order.
In order to support applications that have stacking contexts with `z-index` set to
a value other than `auto` `LayersManager` accepts `zIndex` number. When a `zIndex` value
is passed it will set it as a `z-index` value for all the layers within its context.

What `LayersManager`'s `z-index` value should be set to? There is no need to pass millions
or thousands as its value. In fact, you can build your application in a way that all top
level stacking contexts have the `z-index` value set to no more than `1` so the value you'd need
to pass to the `LayersManager` will be `zIndex={1}` or `zIndex={2}`. If your application
is build in a less structured way you'd need to pass a `zIndex` value that is equal or
greated than the highest `z-index` value of all top level stacking contexts in your application
(**note it may be not the highest `z-index` value across your application**).

  <LayerZIndex />
</Example>

## Tether behavior

`Tether` component provides a behavior where its content positioned relatively to a provided anchor element. Popover component is a good example of the `Tether` component usage.

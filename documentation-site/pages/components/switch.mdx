Switches are used to allow users to to toggle an option on/off.

Switch is used as a toggle to allow the user to make a binary choice usually (but not limited) in
the form of a yes/no or on/off suggestion. Switches are often used in product settings or as filter
options. When engaged (on), Base Web switches are colored and when disengaged (off) they’re grey.

# Modal

<Yard componentName="Modal" placeholderHeight={0} {...modalYardConfig} />

A design structure to organize and hide content, so as not to overwhelm the user.

Modals provide an opportunity to display content, focused actions or alerts while maintaining the
context of an existing view. This limits workflow interruptions and allows for focused
communication and user interactions. There are two types of modals in Base – default and alert.
Each modal share the same anatomy of a header, footer, and shaded background overlay.

Standard modals are basic containers with a close “X” and the ability the dismiss by clicking outside
of the modal bounds. The primary action button is a primary system color, complimented by a grey
cancel action.

The alert modal is to intended to focus the user on an urgent message that requires deliberate
action. By contrast to standard modals, alert modals have no close “X”, nor do they allow for out
of bounds dismissal. The primary action is always a system red with a grey cancel action.

## Accessibility

We have built in functionality based on the recommendations for dialogs and modals in [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#dialog_modal).

- Upon opening, focus will be transferred to the first interactive element (unless `autofocus` is set to false)
- Dialog element has `aria-modal="true"`
- Explicitly exposes a `role` prop to control whether `dialog` or `alertdialog` is used.
- `Tab` key moves between focusable items (form inputs, footer buttons, etc). User should not be able to tab to items outside of modal.
- `Escape` key closes the modal
- Click on backdrop (anywhere outside dialog) hides modal.
- Background is not be scrollable while modal is open (position: fixed).
- Upon closing, focus should return to element that triggered modal.

## Examples

<Example title="Modal With Button Trigger" path="modal/basic.js">
  <ModalBasic />
</Example>

<Example title="Placing initial focus" path="modal/autofocus.js">
  <ModalAutoFocus />
</Example>

The modal will by default focus the first interactive element.
If you want to focus something further down in the tab order, you can use the `autoFocus` property.
This might be useful for targeting the most common action in the modal, such as a confirmation button.

<Example title="Setting the size of the modal" path="modal/sized.js">
  <ModalSized />
</Example>

A typical use case for more complex modals is to increase the size of the modal. Here, we are using a combination of overrides and in-line styles to set the height of the modal to `80vh` and the width to `80vw`. We also set the Modal to be a column-based flex container, while the ModalBody is then set to flex `1 1 0` in order to properly space the header and footer.

<Example
  title="Dealing with a buried interactive element"
  path="modal/buried-interactive-element.js"
>
  <ModalBuriedInteractiveElement />
</Example>

In this example, the first interactive element (a button) is buried by the modal's content.
The normal behavior of the modal will be to skip past the content and focus on the interactive element.
In these cases, it is recommended by WAI-ARIA to avoid skipping content and focusing on a normally non-focusable element at the top of the content (such as an `h1` or `p` tag).
Ideally, we want to avoid an abrupt shift in context both visually and for screen-readers.

You can achieve this with the `FocusOnce` utility component included in `baseui/modal`.
To use it, wrap a non interactive element at the top of the modal in `FocusOnce`.
This will allow the element to be targeted by `autofocus`.
Once the user tabs away, the element will be removed from the tab ordering.

<Example title="Adding nested modals" path="modal/nested.js">
  <ModalNested />
</Example>

**Notice** that you need to handle modals closing order following their stacking order
when multiple modals are dismissed at the same time. This is important to have the body
scrolling restored in an expected way. See how the initial modal's `close` function is
passed as a callback to the modal that is stacked on top of it `toggleConfirm(false, close)`.

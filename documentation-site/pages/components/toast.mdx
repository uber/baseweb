# Toast

<Yard

/>

Toasts can be dismissed and sit on top of a view in various position options - top/right, top/center,
top/left, bottom/right, bottom/center, bottom/left. Toasts are intended to provide feedback to a user
and self-dismiss after a short time with an option to self-dismiss. Each toast can be colored to fit
it’s status type of neutral, positive, warning and alert.

## Accessibility

- Toast notification container element has `role="alert"` set on it.
- When multiple alerts are displayed and positioned relative to the browser window they won't overlap but displayed in a column way, latest notifications are displayed at the initial position of a chosen placement
- When a notification is set to be dismissed automatically after a provided `autoHideDuration` time hovering or focusing the notification will prevent the notification from disappearing and reset the timeout to the initial `autoHideDuration` value

# AspectRatioBox

There are times when it comes in handy to build a box with a specific aspect ratio, given a certain width. This utility component applies CSS to `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements in order to achieve set aspect ratios. (See [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/aspect-ratio-boxes/#article-header-id-6) for why this works.)

Note: **AspectRatioBox** and **AspectRatioBoxBody** components are both implemented using **Block**, and can take all the **Block** properties for styling.

## Examples

<Example title="Basic usage" path="aspect-ratio-box/basic.tsx">
  <AspectRatioBoxBasic />
</Example>

It can be useful to wrap an image component in an **AspectRatioBox**, so content does not reflow as the image loads. This is useful when building UIs for mobile devices, to avoid content moving around as images load on poor network connections.

<Example title="Image in an AspectRatioBox" path="aspect-ratio-box/image.tsx">
  <AspectRatioBoxImage />
</Example>

You could even build a calendar of square buttons with it, that resizes with the window width!

<Example title="Full-width calendar" path="aspect-ratio-box/calendar.tsx">
  <AspectRatioBoxCalendar />
</Example>

<Exports
  component={AspectRatioBoxExports}
  title="AspectRatioBox exports"
  path="baseui/aspect-ratio-box"
/>

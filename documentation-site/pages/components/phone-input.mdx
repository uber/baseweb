# Phone Input

<Yard placeholderHeight={48} {...phoneInputYardConfig} />

The Phone Input is used to collect phone numbers with international dial codes.
It contains a dropdown which allows the user to choose from a list of countries and dial codes.

## Examples

<Example title="Basic usage" path="phone-input/basic.tsx">
  <PhoneInputBasic />
</Example>

<Example title="Localized country names" path="phone-input/localized.tsx">
  <PhoneInputLocalized />
</Example>

<Example
  title="With flag overrides and virtualized dropdown list"
  path="phone-input/flag-overrides.tsx"
>
  <FlagOverrides />
</Example>

<Example title="With nested overrides" path="phone-input/nested-overrides.tsx">
  <WithNestedOverrides />
</Example>

Click [here](/guides/understanding-overrides//#override-nested-components) to learn more about nested overrides.

<Example
  title="Stateful (uncontrolled) usage"
  path="phone-input/uncontrolled.tsx"
>
  <PhoneInputUncontrolled />
</Example>

As with many of our components, there is also an [uncontrolled](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html) version, `StatefulPhoneInput`, which manages its own state.

## Supported Countries

The following countries are available in the country selector dropdown.
You can import these as an object `COUNTRIES` from `baseui/phone-input`.
Note, the country objects are formatted for ease of use with our `Select` component.

```js
COUNTRIES: {
  id: string,      // Country ISO
  label: string,   // Country Name
  dialCode: string // Country Dial Code
}
```

<Block height="400px">
  <Table
    columns={["ID", "Label", "Dial Code"]}
    data={Object.values(COUNTRIES).map((c) => [c.id, c.label, c.dialCode])}
  />
</Block>

<Exports
  component={PhoneInputExports}
  title="Phone Input exports"
  path="baseui/phone-input"
/>

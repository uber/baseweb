# Datepicker

<Yard placeholderHeight={48} {...datepickerConfig} />

A simple and reusable component to work with or select a date or a range of dates.

## Accessibility

- Supports keyboard hotkeys: `tab` - to switch between inputs, arrows, month\year select and day grid. `escape` to close datepicker dropdown.
- When month and year selects focused, `up` and `down` causes dropdown to open and move to value, `enter` and `space` to choose selected year or month.
- When day grid is focused, `left`, `down` `right` and `up` to move through the grid days. `Enter` to pick date.
- When left or right arrow is focused, `enter` causes the same as click on this arrow.
- Accessibility best practices for this component (`aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuetext`, `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`, `role=datepicker`).

## Examples

<Example title="Datepicker basic usage" path="datepicker/basic.tsx">
  <DatepickerBasic />
</Example>

<Example title="Datepicker in a popover" path="datepicker/in-popover.tsx">
  <DatepickerInPopover />
</Example>

<Example
  title="Datepicker with quick select actions"
  path="datepicker/quick-select.tsx"
>
  <DatepickerQuickSelect />
</Example>

<Example title="Datepicker with localization" path="datepicker/i18n.tsx">
  <DatepickerI18n />
</Example>

The `formatString` property supports all the patterns supported by [date-fns' format method](https://date-fns.org/v2.8.1/docs/format).
For example, if someone wants to change it to Australian format, one has to simply pass the `formatString={'d/MM/YYYY'}` as the props.
Please note, that some of the options require you to pass in the `locale` object too, just as shown in this example.

<Example title="Datepicker with overrides" path="datepicker/with-overrides.tsx">
  <DatepickerWithOverrides />
</Example>

<Example title="Datepicker with custom mask" path="datepicker/with-mask.tsx">
  <DatepickerWithMask />
</Example>

When using a custom mask `formatString` prop should be also set to match the mask format.

<Example title="Datepicker with no mask" path="datepicker/null-mask.tsx">
  <DatepickerNullMask />
</Example>

Some date formats will operate better without a restrictive input mask. You can disable that feature by applying `null` to the mask prop.

<Example
  title="Calendar with time select actions"
  path="datepicker/calendar-time-select.tsx"
>
  <DatepickerTimeSelect />
</Example>

<Example
  title="Calendar with multiple months"
  path="datepicker/calendar-multiple-months.tsx"
>
  <DatepickerMultipleMonths />
</Example>

<Example
  title="Calendar with multiple months and labels"
  path="datepicker/calendar-multiple-months-with-label.tsx"
>
  <DatepickerMultipleMonthsWithLabel />
</Example>

<Example
  title="Range Datepicker with Separate Inputs"
  path="datepicker/range-picker-with-separate-inputs.tsx"
>
  <RangeDatepickerSeparateInputs />
</Example>

<Example
  title="Composed single pickers"
  path="datepicker/composed-single-pickers.tsx"
>
  <ComposedSinglePickers />
</Example>

<Example
  title="Composed range pickers"
  path="datepicker/composed-range-pickers.tsx"
>
  <ComposedRangePickers />
</Example>

<Example
  title="Datepicker states"
  path="datepicker/datepickers-color-states.tsx"
>
  <DatepickersColorStates />
</Example>

<Example
  title="Datepicker with timezone selection"
  path="datepicker/datepicker-with-timezone.tsx"
>
  This example works for most use-cases, however certain edge-cases are not
  handled here. If this data is mission critical for your systems, consider
  using Moment.tsx, and pass the date object from Moment.tsx to the datepicker.
  <DatepickerTimezone />
</Example>

<Example
  title="Overriding a nested component"
  path="datepicker/nested-override.tsx"
>
  <NestedOverride />
</Example>

In this example we use a [nested override](/guides/understanding-overrides/#override-nested-components) to customize the `ListItem` within the month/year dropdown (`MonthYearSelectStatefulMenu`).

<Example
  title="Overriding and watching nested component callback"
  path="datepicker/with-callback-overrides.tsx"
>
  <NestedOverridePropMerge />
</Example>

Here we use the most flexible and complex [override by component replacement](/guides/understanding-overrides/#override-the-entire-subcomponent) where we wrap a components onChange handler to subscribe to the datepicker event when a quick selection is picked.

<Exports
  component={DatepickerExports}
  title="Datepicker exports"
  path="baseui/datepicker"
/>

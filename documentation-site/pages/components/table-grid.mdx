# Table-Grid

Display larger amounts of information in a scannable UI. This component is best suited for
applications that _do not_ need to support older browsers like Internet Explorer. It is implemented with
[css-grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) and can likely support more
complex use-cases and layouts. If your application _does_ need legacy support, you may want to explore
baseui's [table](/components/table), components, a visually similar table, but implemented
with [flex-box](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox).

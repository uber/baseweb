# Internationalization

Base Web publishes a language translation utility called `LocaleProvider` so that strings required
to display components can be configured to best support website visitors from non-English-speaking
locations. Please note that some factors of internationalization are not taken care of here, including
pluralization, currency, and list formatting. If you need that support, check out the
[Intl](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl) API.
Date and time formatting are customized with
[date-fns internationalization tools](https://date-fns.org/v2.15.0/docs/I18n).

Below is an example of how to use the `LocaleProvider`. This component should generally wrap the
application and must be provided with a dictionary of terms translated to the appropriate language.
It's up to developers to handle state management and language switching based on their site
requirements. In this example, we're customizing labels in the pagination component
into Hungarian. 'next' becomes 'Következő' and 'prev' becomes 'Előző'. Fill out other terms in
the locale if your application requires it.

<Example
  title="LocaleProvider example"
  path="internationalization/example.js"
>
  <LocaleProviderExample />
</Example>

The next example shows how to leverage the `date-fns` internationalization helpers. View their
[documentation](https://date-fns.org/v2.15.0/docs/I18n) for additional information. It also
customizes the `formatString` to display the chosen date in a familiar format to the target location.
View the date-fns [format documentation](https://date-fns.org/v2.8.1/docs/format) for how to use
this feature.

<Example
  title="Datepicker localization example"
  path="datepicker/i18n.js"
>
  <DatepickerLocalizationExample />
</Example>

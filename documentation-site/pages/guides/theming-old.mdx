# Theming

<Notification

    Body: {style: {width: 'auto'}},

  In this guide, you'll learn how to customize Base Web through the theme object
  and how to create your own theme.
</Notification>

## Intro to theming

Base Web ships by default with the `Light` theme. We understand that in some cases
you want to change the look and feel of the components. To do so, follow the steps
outlined here.

## The `ThemeProvider`

With the `ThemeProvider`, you can apply a theme to your application locally. By default,
Base Web ships with a light and a dark theme. For global theming, please refer to
the [BaseProvider](/components/base-provider/).

If you'd like to use a different theme in one part of your application, \
you can locally wrap that part with the `ThemeProvider` to override the theme locally:

```jsx
import {DarkTheme, ThemeProvider} from 'baseui';

export default function SomeDarkThemedPages() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={DarkTheme}>
      <div>
        This is a dark themed page - all the Base Web components used here will
        use the dark theme, as well as the theme object accessed through the
        styled function will use the values from the dark theme
      </div>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

## Creating a custom theme

### Define your theme building primitives

Theme building primitives are used to define the colors and fonts for the components. An example of
theme building primitives can be found in the [light theme primitives](https://github.com/uber/baseweb/blob/master/src/themes/index.js).

### Define any additional theme overrides

Theme overrides are used to change values in the theme like paddings or borders.
To learn more about what you can override, check out the [creator](https://github.com/uber/baseweb/blob/master/src/themes/creator.js).

### Putting it all together

In practice, you can define your custom theme using this approach:

```js
import {createTheme, lightThemePrimitives} from 'baseui';

const yourTheme = createTheme(
  {
    ...lightThemePrimitives,
    // add all the properties here you'd like to override from the light theme primitives
    primaryFontFamily: '"Comic Sans MS", cursive, sans-serif',
  },
  {
    // add all the theme overrides here - under the hood it uses deep merge
    animation: {
      timing100: '0.50s',
    },
  },
);
```

If you are using flow type with a custom theme, visit the [`styled`](/components/styled) function page for more information.

## Theming Values

<Colors />
<Sizing />
<Lighting />
<Borders />
<Typography />

### The shape of the theme file

<JSON src={LightTheme} />

## Overriding icons

With Base Web, you can use your custom icon set. To do that, you have to provide your icons in the theme.

You can use any React components as Icon replacements, as long as they accept the following properties:

- `size`, to set their width and height,
- `color`, to set their colors,
- `title`, to set the title of the icon for accessibility purposes.

You can find more about the [Icon API here](/components/icon/#icon-api) and also refer to this [list of available icons](https://baseweb.design/components/icon/#available-icons).

The example below overrides the `ChevronLeft` icon with the `ArrowLeft` icon, making the pagination slightly different.

All the icons that can be found on the Icon component page can be overridden using this technique.

<Example title="Pagination icon overrides" path="theme/icon-overrides.js">
  <IconOverrides />
</Example>

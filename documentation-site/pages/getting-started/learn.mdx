# Learning Base UI

We understand that learning new libraries have their own set of challenges. To help you get started, we are here to help!

## Your first Base UI example

You can find the simples Base UI application example in the [Usage](/getting-started/usage) section, that only contains a button.

## Your next Base UI example

A more complex application using Base UI can be found [here](https://github.com/tajo/fusion-baseui), that helps you build an applicatio
on top of Base UI, step by step.

## Next steps

It's time for you to build something on your own! If you got stuck, or if you've built something using Base UI,
please let us know, and we are happy to help, or feature your application on this website!

You can reach us in our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/baseui/shared_invite/enQtNDI0NTgwMjU0NDUyLTk3YzM1NWY2MjY3NTVjNjk3NzY1MTE5OTI4Y2Q2ZmVkMTUyNDc1MTcwYjZhYjlhOWQ2M2NjOWJkZmQyNjFlYTA)
or through [GitHub issues](https://github.com/uber-web/baseui/issues).

Once you have a better understanding of Base UI, we recommend diving into more advanced topics like:

* [How Theming works](/theming/custom-themes)
* [Understanding Overrides](/theming/understanding-overrides)
